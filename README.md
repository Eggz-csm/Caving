## Description
  
  "Caving!!" will be a fun game, usually meant for a group of friends, in which you and your friends will traverse a cave was small worms which can burrow through walls to reach objectives or items which you have to retreive. The further in to the caves you go you run the risk of finding more and more monsters or creatures which will vicously dismember you in front of your friends!!!! (Exciting!!) after you and your friends feel that you have ventured deep enough, you will use the last of your strength to hopefully reach the surface and reap the rewards of your adventures, with perchance the option to kill your freinds at the end to take some of their loot! (How evil..)

## Mock-Ups

A basic idea of what a map (only a small portion of an actual normal maps size) may look like, maps are generated each time you play!
